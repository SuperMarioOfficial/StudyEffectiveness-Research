# Active recall 
The recall method is the method of training your brain to retrieve informations from your memory in the most efficient way.  
Active recall is the idea to force your brain to recall some piece of information effictevely. More often the brain is forced to recall something during the time, stronger it will be the link to that piece of information. In a certain way it can be compared to what backpropagation is in deep-learning. Therefore, writing down questions and answering them later on force your brain to remember them. 
  
###  > Active questions creation and answering
Use [Cornell Notes Method of Taking Notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsR-10piMp4) and create many questions, then in revision answer those questions. 
###  > Passive questions answering
Save questions from the book and slides and answer them.
###  > Explain to "someone"

###  > Flash cards Anki
All previous methods can be used to create cards to answer them.

The rate of forgetting is minimised if students interact (re-read/discuss/write/engage) with their notes within 24 hours. A second repetition for a shorter period of time within a day brings recall back up to 100%. A third repetition within a week for an even shorter time brings recall back to 100%.
   - Space repetition is the idea that spacing your active recall sessions your brain will implant that memories in the long-term memory side of your brain. A simple way to do it is to give two or three days distance between each topic and then try to answer again to the same questions you answered on day one.
   - ***Longer delay between initial learning and recalling facts was associated with poorer retention rate.***
   - ***In a final test 1 week later, the group that learned at expanding time intervals performed significantly better than the group learning with steady intervals***

 # Study Algorithm
- ***scoping the subject/topic***: syllabus -> slides -> book chapters 
  - this ***should not*** take more than 1 hour if done the same day or even better if you do it the day before the starting of the study cycle.
  - writing down all words and topic that you do not know the meaning
  - writing down questions about the subject on a piece of paper Cornell style [link 1](https://youtu.be/fDbxPVn02VU?t=38), [link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIyDJK_SAjs&t=268s)
    - usually at the end of the chapters there are a set of questions
    - check for questions in the slides
    - for each topic of the syllabus you should at the least know to desribe to someone that does not know anything about the subject "what is". [Feynman Technique](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2af4e9efa584f1c46758ea56c085e3bf)
- ***Active recall*** [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE)[source 2](https://youtu.be/V-UvSKe8jW4?t=430), [source 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4031794/)
  - for each word write down nodes of everything associated with that you remember about 
  - answer the questions in bullet point on the right side of your notebook (Cornell Notes Method of Taking Notes). 
- ***space repetition*** [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5A26Sc63F0)
  - create a spreadhsheet: topic, date repetition 1, date repetition 2, ...
    - use colors to determine which topic is easier and which is worst
  - This sequence is for ***1 block == 1 slide*** of study.(study block b1=50m), (block-revision b1r=30m), (block-exercises b1e=50m)
     - First day
        -  [b1] -> [Break 15 min] -> [b1r] -> [Break 30 m] -> [b1e] -> [Break 1 h 30m] -> [b1r]
     -  ------------------- ***Recall it the next evening*** ------------------
        - [b1r] -> [Break 15 min] -> [b1e] -> [Break 45 m] -> [explain each topic to "people"]
     -  ------------------- ***Skip 1 day*** ---------------------------------- 
        - [b1r] -> [Break 15 min] -> [b1e]  -> [Break 45 m] -> [explain each topic to "people"]
     -  ------------------- ***Skip 2 days*** --------------------------------- 
        - [b1r] -> [Break 15 min] -> [b1e]  -> [Break 45 m] -> [explain each topic to "people"]
     -  ------------------- ***Skip 22 days*** -------------------------------- 
        - [b1r] -> [Break 15 min] -> [b1e]  -> [Break 45 m] -> [explain each topic to "people"]
   
   - at the end of each new evening spend 10 minute thinking about what you learned that day.
   

 - ***revision***
   - start from the last chapter and move backwards 
   - write down on a paper or excel file each topic you are not familiar with
